                    Achieving food security and livelihood development among vulnerable households in the semi-arid regions is challenged by water scarcity and climate change. To alleviate the challenges of water scarcity and climate change impacts, farmers are supported to adopt different climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices. These include irrigation agriculture, from cross-sectional sources
                    (Rain water harvesting, Borehole drilling, water pan/dam construction, shallow hand dug wells and springs),  dryland farming, Small and Micro-Enterprises (both livestock, fish and agricultural products)

            The project aims to increase community resilience in the Lokichoggio-Kapoeta cross-border region through capacity-building, livelihood expansion, and partnership development. It will focus on establishing sustainable mechanisms for resource sharing, drawing on proven strategies and prioritizing inclusive community consultations. The project will mitigate the impact of climatic challenges and foster long-term resilience, with targeted support for women and girls. The outcomes include increased resilience to economic benefits, strengthened capacities for climate adaptations, and collaborative advocacy across borders. The project will be implemented in collaboration with the Organization for Peace, Relief and Development, covering a period of 18 months. The geographical area targeted by the project is the cross-border area of Lokichoggio Sub County in Turkana County, Kenya, and Kapoeta East County in Eastern Equatoria State, South Sudan.
